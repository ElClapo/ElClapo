Hi everyone I'm @Elclapo <br/>
I currently suck at Computer Science and coding. <br/>
Right now I am studying: <br/> 
- C++ (w/ Igor Bogoslavskiy's tutorials) <br/>
- Linux <br/>
- German <br/>
My goal is to get eventually good at programming and to apply this knowledge to robotics. <br/>
See you out there :>)
